Task 1 – GPT-2 Text Generation | Screen Recording

This screen recording demonstrates the completion of Task 1 assigned during the FutureIntern Internship Program. The task involved using GPT-2 for text generation.

In the video:

I accessed an online GPT-2 model platform.

I provided input prompts and generated text outputs using GPT-2.

The recording shows how the model responds to different prompts in real time.

This task helped me understand the basics of AI text generation and how GPT-2 works.
