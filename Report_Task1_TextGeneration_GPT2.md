# Task 1 â€“ Text Generation Using GPT-2 (FutureIntern Internship)

This repository contains the implementation of **text generation using the GPT-2 model** as part of **Task 1** for the FutureIntern internship.

## What I Did

- Used **Google Colab** to access a Python-based notebook.
- Loaded the **pre-trained GPT-2 model** using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
- Entered a custom text prompt to generate AI-based completions.
- Ran the model to get multiple text outputs and analyzed their creativity.
- Saved the best output for future reference or content generation.

## Platform Used

- **Google Colab**
